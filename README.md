# Learning C++ Projects
This repository has all of my C++ projects from when I was learning the C++ last year (2021). This includes:
- a Roman numerals addition program
- a simple encrypter and decrypter program; labelled as SectionChallenge10
- a simple program to deal with a list of number (add a number, delete a number, find the mean, etc); labelled as SectionChallenge9
- a program to find change of some amount of money; labelled as SectionChallenge8
- a program to implement a merge sort
- and more!
